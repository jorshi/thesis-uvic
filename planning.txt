Thesis Planning, TODO, and timeline
===================================

Week 1:
-------

August 18th

- Go through all the chapters and start to list what I need to do in order to complete them
- Start with the SpiegeLib work, and be precise

August 20th
- Currently working through the SpiegeLib work. Want to finish that chapter while do as little additionally work as possible. i.e. don't do additional research. 

August 21st
- Continuing to finish up the SpiegeLib chapter. Have moved onto the evaluation portion of the experiment.
- Still need to finish off the evaluation, probably reproduce the results to get all the figures.

Week 2:
-------

August 23rd
- Goals:
    - Finish up the evaluation section of spiegelib
    - Split out the two chapters
    - Start filling out the introduction sections for both of those chapters (starting with an outline)

August 24th
- Goals:
    - Outline for the background section
    - Move background sections from other chapters in background
    - Continue to fill out outline

August 25th
- Goals:
    - Continue to shuffle around background sections from other parts of the paper
    - Start to organize any necessary citations into the correct sections.
    - Continue to build out the outline with shorter bullet point type sentences

August 26th
- Goals:
    - Read some parts of the Russ textbook 
    - Write the synthesizer background section

Week 3:
-------
Goals: Get a really solid first draft of the background section completed for editing.

September 1st
- Background section has become a bit of a beast. Still working on the synthesizer section.
- Goals:
    - Finish up first draft on the synthesizer section

September 5th
- Lol background section. Working on the Synthesizer Programming section

Week 4:
-------
Last week was challenging. Rachel and I got sick and I have been struggling with quite a bit of stress. Looking forward to getting back on a track a bit this week.

Goals:
- Continue to work on background section two hours every day and get closer to having a complete draft of that section. Continue to work through the writing of synthesizer programming and the opportunities.
- Spend some time reworking / recreating results for the inverse synthesizer experiments and see if I can get the RenderMan library working on Ubuntu.
- Read some more papers on the inverse synthesis problem for the related work section -- want to understand the autoencoder approaches better.

September 7th
Goals:
- Get all references in place for the synthesizer programming chapter
- First draft written of synthesizer programming section.
- Start compiling a "to read" section of the inverse synthesizer chapter
- Explore RenderMan in Linux for a work block

September 8th
Tough day. Was not mentally in it.

September 9th
Goals:
- Try to ease back into this work.
- 30min writing block on synth programming
- 1hr research block on more recent inverse synthesis problems
- 30min writing block on background

Week 5:
-------
Making more space for my thesis! The competition work is going to slow now, so that feels like a breathe of fresh air. Carson's stuff is getting close as well. I do feel stressed about that work a bit. I feel a bit challenged by the fact that my background section has taken me so long, but I think getting through the synthesizer chapter at least as a first draft will be positive for morale. Shifting focus to completing a first draft of this entire document as quickly as possible. I've been thinking about doing some additional experiments with torchsynth to build on the inverse synthesis (perhaps the evolutionary search strategy in the UI). That can certainly be an add on. This could be implemented in Django on google colab -- that would be super cool. Could also create that synth interface as well. But. First, we need to finish the thesis.

- Final chapter on UI could probably be restructured a little bit to help propose some design criteria for creating engaging interaction paradigms for synthesizer user interfaces -- and then provide a bit of a prototype system. That would be hype. Basically an idea system should scal, but also provide a number of different interaction paradigms. torchsynth is cool b/c it can be so fast. Potential tool for searching for sounds.

Goals:
Definitely complete an initial first pass on the background chapter(s). Would be great to have some more structure in place for finishing the other chapters of the document. I'd like to have my first draft fully completed before going to Vancouver next weekend. I think it is possible.

September 14th:
Goals:
- Create framework and some structure for the ASP background chapter.
- Start filling in the chapter

September 16th
Goals:
- Complete first draft of that ASP chapter

September 17th
- Continue to finish first draft of ASP chapter

September 19th
- Continuiing to finish the first draft of the ASP chapter.
- Want to read some of the references and try to fill in the next steps for the intuitive controls and exploratory interfaces.
- Thinking about restructuring that chapter a little bit to support the fact that inverse synthesis takes up quite a bit more space in there than the other methods.


Week 6:
-------
Four weeks left to get this thing done.

Goal: Complete the first full draft of thesis by Friday night.

September 20th
Goals:
- Complete first draft version of the two background chapters

September 21st
Goals:
- torchsynth and SynthExplorer chapters clean up

September 22nd
Goals:
- Rerun (if necessary) and create all the results / figures / plots for the inverse synthesizer experiment chapters

September 23rd
Goals:
- First completed draft of the spiegelib and inverse synthesis experiments chapter

September 24th
Goals:
- Write the conclusion, introduction, abstract and title page.


TODO / Plan:
Abstract:
- Write it

Introduction:
- Write it

Synthesizer Background:
    - Figures: skeumorphism for example, some waveforms perhaps?
    - Tighten up the synthesizer programming section. Add in some of the stuff from Justice / Ethington that acknowledged some of the challenges of synthesizer programming. 

Automatic Synthesizer Programming:
    - Finish up the remainder of chapter with interaction styles.
    - Go through and rewrite the introduction - frame this an overview of the field of automatic synthesizer programming. Provide necassary background information, formulate the problem that is trying to be solved from an interaction perspective.
    - Summarize some of the related work from the perspective of the interaction style, as well as giving an overview and background on some of the algorithmic techniques that have been used.
    - Background section needs to be tightened up - probably move the audio representation section into background.

SpiegeLib:
- Create a research pipeline figure?
- Fill out other aspects of the library
- Add some more code examples
- Add a figure for the subjective evaluation

Inverse Synthesis Experiment:
- Input size for the spiegelib architectures
- Render out all the loss plots for spiegelib experiments
- Render out all the iteration plots for the GAs (with labels on the axes)
- Informal listening on MAE to comment on the quality of each result.
- Double check the spectrogram plots for the GA and CNN

Torchsynth:
 - Rewrite introduction to reframe the goals of the contribution. Note some of the challenges with deep learning and how this can be addressed with the GPU  ddsp synthesizer. Both from the deep learning persepctive as well as from the search perspective. Prototyping! Learning audio representations. Pre-training.

SynthExplorer:
- First iteration should be minimal effort, exactly what I have. This would be great to work on over the following weeks since it could drive home some points on designing good music interaction tools.

Conclusion / Future Work.
- Write it.
