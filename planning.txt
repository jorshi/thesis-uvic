August 18th

- Go through all the chapters and start to list what I need to do in order to complete them
- Start with the SpiegeLib work, and be precise

August 20th
- Currently working through the SpiegeLib work. Want to finish that chapter while do as little additionally work as possible. i.e. don't do additional research. 

August 21st
- Continuing to finish up the SpiegeLib chapter. Have moved onto the evaluation portion of the experiment.
- Still need to finish off the evaluation, probably reproduce the results to get all the figures.

TODO:

- Input size for the spiegelib architectures
- Render out all the loss plots for spiegelib experiments
- Render out all the iteration plots for the GAs (with labels on the axes)
- Split out the Chapter 3 into 2 chapters: SpiegeLib and the experiment
- Informal listening on MAE to comment on the quality of each result.
