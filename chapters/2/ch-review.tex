% So potentially the first chapter will be background on audio synthesizers
\chapter{Background}
\label{chapter:background}
- Research in this field is inherently interdisciplinary background covers many different areas including HCI, DSP, Machine learning
- What is the main goal? Reiterate here perhaps: "We want to develop a method for improving the user interface for synthesizer users" -- 
- In the field of HCI the study of creativity support tools is related to this:

% Unsure whether or not this is going to be its own chapter yet ...
\chapter{Automatic Synthesizer Programming}
\label{chapter:asp-background}
- The field of ASP has been an active area of research for 40+ years.
- What did the early work have to say about programming synthesizers? Why did the early work exist?
- This chapter provides background to the field of automatic synthesizer programming and
