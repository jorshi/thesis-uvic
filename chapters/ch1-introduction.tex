\label{chapter:introduction}
The sound synthesizer is a familiar tool for many musicians and audio practitioners working in music, film, video games, and other industries related to audio production. Despite their widespread use, the task of programming new sounds into a synthesizer is complex and requires a thorough understanding of sound design principles and technical details. It is not uncommon for a software synthesizer to have thirty or more parameters displayed on a user interface (UI) and labelled using technical names specific to a particular device \cite{rasmussen2018evaluating}. Synthesizer programming involves manually adjusting these parameters to achieve a desired sound. The task is further complicated by the fact that modifications to these parameters is often not intuitively reflected in the end sonic result.
The implication of this is that there is a large learning curve associated with becoming an effective synthesizer programmer, and even then the task can be disruptive to the creative process. 

The central goal of this thesis is to support the development of methods that address the challenges of synthesizer programming. Such methods have the potential to make working with synthesizers more accessible and to enable more people to be creative more often. The benefit of engaging in the creative process on a regular basis has been proven \cite{conner2018everyday} and technology has the power enable individuals to express themselves in domains that were previously unavailable to them \cite{tavana2015democracy}. New synthesizers are constantly being released and are now widely accessible on consumer devices including personal computers and mobile phones [cite?]. Developing methods that lower the barrier to entry and encourage the use of synthesizers can support users in engaging in creative endeavours more regularly. The potential benefit is not limited to novice users, experienced synthesizer users and other audio practitioners have also identified the challenges of synthesizer programming as being an impediment to their creative process and serve to benefit from research in this direction \cite{krekovic2014intelligent}. 

[Add a sentence or two in here about what I actually present in this thesis]

- Specific emphasis is placed on encouraging reproducible research and open sharing in the field. An evaluation of several recent approaches is provided in an open-source framework designed to facilitate sharing and open evaluation

\section{Research Context}
\subsection{Music and Audio Production}
With the rise of personal computers there was a movement towards digital methods for producing, distributing, and consuming music in the 80s and 90s [cite?]. As computers became more powerful and consumers started to accumulate large collections of digital music, the need for improved methods for organizing and browsing these collection became apparent. Music information retrieval (MIR) is the field of study that was born out of the need to navigate these increasingly large collections of digital music [cite]. Simultaneously, many of the processing for recording and producing music were also being moved onto computers. The development of affordable computers that could run digital audio workstations (DAWs) along with a proliferation of companies developing audio production software has resulted in the decentralization of music production. Traditionally restricted only to those who could afford to work in expensive recording studios had access to high-quality recording equipment [cite for the record production text]. Affordable technology has enabled virtually anyone to write, record, and produce their own music; grammy award winning records are now being written and produced in bedrooms [find cite for eilish]. Despite this, and the unprecedented amount of audio software available to consumers, there is still a large learning curve associated with learning to use audio software. Intelligent music production (IMP) is a field of study related to MIR that has grown to address these challenges and focuses on creating improved user interactions and automatic aspects of the music production process \cite{de2017ten, moffat2019approaches}. 

\subsection{Automatic Synthesizer Programming}

The Yamaha DX7 synthesizer was released in 

Automatic synthesizer programming is the field of research centered around addressing the challenges with synthesizer programming. It is an inherently interdisciplinary topic, drawing from advancements from fields including digital signal processing, creativity support, music interaction, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

on the topic of inverse synthesis, also referred to a sound matching, which is focused on automatically finding parameters for a synthesizer to reproduce a target sound as closely as possible. Work was first published on this topic in the late 1970s \cite{justice1979analytic} and has grown in popularity in recent years in parallel with advancements in deep learning \cite{lecun2015deep}. The term automatic synthesizer programming was coined by Matthew Yee-King in 2008 and to refer to synthesizer sound matching \cite{yee2008synthbot}.

The term automatic synthesizer programming was coined by Matthew Yee-King in the

% Synthesizers have become ubiquitous in audio production and entire genres of music have been developed around their use. Bebe and Louis Barron produced the first electronic film score for the movie "Forbidden Planet" in 1955 using synthetic sounds. Since then the use of synthesizers for movies and video games has also become common-place.

- Where can this Laurie Spiegel quote fit in?
"I automate whatever can be automated to be freer to focus on those aspects of music that can't be automated. The challenge is to figure out which is which." - Laurie Spiegel \cite{hinkle2006women}

% Is this maybe introduction material?
- How can I keep this section more simple?

The growing accessibility of hardware and software synthesizers has resulted in an unprecedented number of audio practitioners and hobbyists purchasing and desiring to learn how to program synthesizers. This is reinforced by the fact that there are currently 147 different videos courses available for sale on the Groove3 online education platform teaching synthesizer programming for various virtual instruments\footnote{\url{https://www.groove3.com/browse}}.


In a recent study, users reported on the challenges associated with learning to user various synthesizers and a expressed a desire for improved user interaction methods \cite{krekovic2019insights}. The growth in interest in amongst musicians to learn to program synthesizers, along with desires for more intuitive ways to work with them points to the need for additional research in this area. This serves as motivation for the research conducted in this thesis.

Maybe this should go above in introduction.
[rmba conversations] \textit{et al.} identified that music producers often feel like the task of browsing for sounds using traditional methods is tedious and takes them out of the creative flow. Similarly, [krekovic] \textit{et al.} identified that synthesizer users felt like programming sounds in software synthesizer interfaces was complex and required time and effort. Users' in their study expressed

% Can I add some context here for MIR, Intelligent Music Production, and such? Or does this go in a research context section? Still want to keep this chapter snappy.
- Understand the field of automatic synthesizer programming,

\subsubsection{Availability of Synthesizers}
- Democratization of audio (What's that reference on GarageBand?) Something about the introduction of synthesizers, then the Yamaha DX7, which was notoriously difficult to program
- Add in some statistics regarding modular synthesis, KVR, Groove3 -- to provide some context on current trends in synthesizer use and where things are at. 

\subsubsection{Democratization of Sound}
- Democratization of sound \cite{tavana2015democracy} -- GarageBand bit. Gateway DAW to more complicated software like Ableton Live. Gender aspect to this as well. "The feminist implication of GarageBand definitely encouraged a lot of my female friends to explore something that had previously seemed out of reach." "While it may have introduced a whole lot more people of all genders to an array of options for home recording and self-producing, an overwhelming majority of engineers in studios are still male." Indeed, recent estimates reveal that less than five percent of sound engineers and producers in the music business are women. (Maybe include Amandine's paper here?) 
- Krekovi\'{c}'s study where a vast majority of users were male

\subsubsection{Gateway Synthesizers}
Enabling more people to be creative!

% My main statement about the introduction is:
% \textit{"keep it short and write it last".} The main features should be as follows:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item {3-4 pages at most;}
% \item {Start with a VERY short statement of the problem (2-3 sentences) - the problem should be stated, not described, as there will be a whole chapter for that;}
% \item {State why the problem is important, its impact, how well it has been studied recently, its application (3 sentences) - this should be again a brief motivation, leaving a full impact description to later in the document;}
% \item {Give a sketch of the new approach - there will be a whole chapter with all the details, now just impress the reader about what is the new approach, just as you would do if your boss asked you at work during an elevator ride;}
% \item {Sketch the main new ideas of the new approach - again briefly, just get the reader interested;}
% \item {Give a short statement regarding the results, nothing too elaborate, but certainly you should blow your horn and make sure that the reader is intrigued;}
% \item {Interspersed in all the writing above do not forget the marketing angle, trying to suggest forcefully why the reader should keep reading;}
% \item {Give an outline of what is to come in the organization of the thesis overall - you will find one below for this document.}

% \end{enumerate}

% Finally the strong suggestion is write the introduction chapter last. It will be faster, you will know what to say as the rest is already there, and the abstract, introduction and conclusion will be a mirror and complement of each other. You may well ask where to start writing your thesis. My view is included in the organization below.

% \section{Automating Synthesizers}
% The use of sound synthesizers in the fields of music composition, production, and performance is widespread, but the task of programming a synthesizer is complex and requires a thorough understanding of technical details. It is not uncommon for a software synthesizer to have 30+ parameters displayed on a user interface (UI) and labelled using technical names \cite{rasmussen2018evaluating}. Manually programming sounds using such a large set of parameters is a daunting task. Synthesizer programming is further complicated by the fact that modifications to parameters are often not intuitively reflected in the end sonic result. This disconnect can be disruptive to the creative process. Automatic synthesizer programming (ASP) is the field of research focused on addressing these challenges in programming synthesizers.

%  Early ASP research emerged in the late 1970s with work that focused on the use of analytic methods to estimate the parameters for frequency modulation (FM) synthesis \cite{justice1979analytic}. That work was an example of synthesizer sound matching in which a system estimates synthesizer parameters to replicate a target sound. Since then a large volume of work on synthesizer sound matching has been published and has explored a variety of synthesis techniques and algorithmic methods. One popular approach is the use of evolutionary algorithms \cite{horner1993machine, mitchell2007evolutionary, yee2007evolving, yee2008synthbot, heise2009automatic, roth2011comparison, tatar2016automatic, smith2017play}. More recently, deep learning techniques have been explored \cite{yee2018automatic, barkan2019inversynth, esling2020flow}. Other methods that have been studied include semantic descriptions \cite{ethington1994seawave, johnson2006timbre, krekovic2016algorithm}, interactive methods \cite{johnson1999exploring, dahlstedt2001creating, yee2016use}, and sound matching with vocal imitations \cite{mcartwright2014, zhang2018visualization}.
 
%  A recent user study conducted by Krekovi{\'c} et al. confirmed the desire among synthesizer users for improved means of working with their synthesizers \cite{krekovic2019insights}. 
%  %Users identified approaches they felt would be particularly beneficial, which included automatic sound matching and improvements to user interface design. 
%  While recent research has produced promising results, automatically programming a modern software synthesizer still presents challenges. Current evolutionary techniques face issues including time complexity \cite{tatar2016automatic}, while recent deep learning approaches have challenges in consistently producing accurate reproductions \cite{yee2018automatic}. The desires expressed by the users in Krekovi{\'c} et al.'s study, coupled with the need for further research and improvement noted in the existing body of work, point to the need for further development in ASP.
 
%  The work presented here attempts to continue this development, and promote collaboration and reproducibility in ASP research through the introduction of \mintinline{python}{spiegelib}, an open-source library written in the Python programming language. Vandewalle et al. argue that reproducibility in computational science research increases the impact of a work and they provide a framework for evaluating the quality of reproducibility \cite{vandewalle2009reproducible}. The aim of \mintinline{python}{spiegelib} is to provide a platform for researchers of automatic synthesizer programming to develop, test, and share implementations in a way that promotes reproducibility at the highest level. \mintinline{python}{spiegelib} stands for Synthesizer Programming with Intelligent Exploration, Generation, and Evaluation Library. The name \mintinline{python}{spiegelib} was chosen to pay homage to Laurie Spiegel, an early pioneer in electronic music composition. Laurie Spiegel is known for utilizing synthesizers and software to automate certain aspects of the music composition process. Her philosophy for using technology in music serves as a motivation for the \mintinline{python}{spiegelib} software library: "I automate whatever can be automated to be freer to focus on those aspects of music that can't be automated. The challenge is to figure out which is which." \cite{hinkle2006women}


% Introduce automatic synthesizer programming. Tie it to intelligent music production \cite{moffat2019approaches} \cite{de2017ten} and creative MIR \cite{humphrey2013brief}.

% \subsection{History}
% DX7 plays an important role here - made synthesizers more widely available but programming them was notoriously difficult. 9 out of 10 DX7s that went in for service had factory presets intact (Reference needed). Almost immediately researchers became interested in learning how to estimate synthesizer presets for FM algorithms which spread into non-linear synthesis methods, then wavetable synthesis, then physical modelling, granular, additive. (References needed for synthesis types). 

% Justice 1979 \cite{justice1979analytic}  - Automatic FM matching. Early example of looking try to find a coarse match of FM generated tone to the parameters (ie examples were FM generated). Beauchamp 1982 \cite{beauchamp1982synthesis} - Frequency domain matching of FM tones. Included in a larger study involving spectral centroid matching in nonlinear synthesis. Early automatic spectral match. Also looked at non-linear and filter model. Found that non-linear/filter model worked better. Payne 1987 \cite{payne1987microcomputer} Looked at automatic FM tone matching to the acoustic sounds - using DX7 and hilbert transform as well. Delprat et al. 1990 \cite{delprat1990parameter} using wavelets for non-linear synthesis parameter estimation. Horner at al. early example of automatic synthesizer preset generation in 1993 \cite{horner1993machine}. Attempted to match FM parameters with a harmonic signal using a genetic algorithm. Horner et al. then applied denetic algorithm applied to wavetable synthesis \cite{horner1993methods}. Vouri and V{\"a}lim{\"a}ki on parameter estimation for physical modelling of flute tones \cite{vuori1993parameter}. Fujinaga and Vantomme 1994 Genetic Algorithms applied to granular synthesis \cite{fujinaga1994genetic}. SeaWave by Ethington and Punch, a synthesizer that can be controlled using vocabulary. Has a pre-defined set of descriptors \cite{ethington1994seawave}. Miranda 1995 paper proposing a system utilizing AI to automatically program a generic synth using vocabulary \cite{miranda1995artificial}. Horner 2003 paper reviews FM and wavetable synthesis as well as approaches to automatic parameter matching \cite{horner2003auto}.


% \section{User Interface Design}
% \subsection{Synthesizer Programming}
% Seago identified disconnect between the language of users and the language used in synthesizer interfaces \cite{seago2004critical}. Recent work focussed on synthesizer UIs \cite{rasmussen2018evaluating}. Krekovic in a 2019 study of 112 synthesizer users, reported most participants reported feeling like the process of modifying or creating new synthesizer patches was a challenging process and not intuitive \cite{krekovic2019insights}. A majority of users' felt like more intuitive interfaces was the area that would be most beneficial in helping them during the process of programming a synth. Users also felt that sound matching would be helpful. Krekovic identifies that relatively little research has been completed in the area of synthesizer user interfaces. This is reflective of recent research focussed on human computer interface and ui design for music applications \cite{pardo2019learning}\cite{knees2019intelligent}.
