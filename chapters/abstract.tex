\chapter*{Abstract}
The sound synthesizer is an electronic musical instrument that has become commonplace in audio production for music, film, television and video games. Despite their widespread use, creating new sounds on a synthesizer -- referred to as synthesizer programming -- is a complex task that can impede the creative process. The challenges with synthesizer programming stem from a disconnect between the parameters on the interface of a synthesizer and the associated auditory result. The primary aim of this thesis is to support the development of techniques that address this disconnect and assist synthesizer users to reach their creative goals. One of the main focuses of this thesis is the development of algorithms for inverse synthesis, a technique that involves the prediction of synthesizer parameters that results in a sound that matches a target. Deep learning and evolutionary programming techniques are compared on a baseline FM synthesis problem and a novel hybrid approach that produces top results in less than half the computation time is presented. Another focus is the development of intuitive user interfaces that encourage novice users to use synthesizers and begin to learn the relationship between sounds and synthesizer parameters. To this end, a novel interface (Synth Explorer) is introduced that uses a visualization representation of sounds on a two-dimension layout. An additional goal of this thesis is to support further development in automatic synthesizer programming and continued research on deepening our understanding of the relationship between synthesizer parameters and the associated auditory output through the contribution of open-source software libraries and freely available datasets. As a component of the work conducted as a part of this thesis an open-source library (SpiegeLib) was developed to support reproducibility, sharing, and evaluation of techniques for inverse synthesis. A large-scale one billion sound dataset paired with synthesizer parameters (synth1B1) and GPU-enabled modular synthesizer (torchsynth) are also introduced to support further exploration of the complex relationship between synthesizer parameters and auditory results.

% The experiments conducted as a part of this thesis evaluate several approaches to inverse synthesis, including genetic algorithms and deep learning models, that have been used in previous work. A novel approach is presented that produces results that are as good as the best method evaluated, in less than half the computation time.

% Sound synthesizers are electronic musical instruments that generate synthetic sounds. They were popularized through the last half of the 1900s and the sounds they create have permeated through almost all genres of music and are commonplace in soundtracks for film, television, and video games. Anyone with a laptop or a mobile phone has the power to make sounds with a synthesizer. Despite their widespread availability, synthesizers are challenging to use. Creating a new sound on a synthesizer -- referred to as synthesizer programming -- is a complex task that involves the manually adjustment of a potentially large number of parameters that are labelled using technical names. This process is further complicated by the fact that modifications to these parameters often do not lead to intuitive auditory results. This disconnect between synthesizer parameters and the associated sound means that there is a large learning curve involved in using a synthesizer effectively. Automatic synthesizer programming is the field of research that developed to address the challenges with synthesizer programming and has the goal of creating more intuitive methods of programming sounds into a synthesizer to support the creative goals of synthesizer users. The work presented in this thesis shares this goal and contributes to the field of automatic synthesizer programming in a number of ways.

% Sound synthesizers are electronic musical instruments that generate synthetic sounds. Through the last half of the 1900s their popularity grew as more affordable and accessible synthesizers were developed, supported by the development of digital technology and personal computers. The sounds of synthesizers have permeated through almost all genres of music and are commonplace in soundtracks for films, television, and games. Anyone with a laptop or a mobile phone has the power to make sounds with a synthesizer. However, anyone who has tried to program a new sound into a synthesizer will attest to the fact that the usability of these devices has yet to catch up to their availability.
