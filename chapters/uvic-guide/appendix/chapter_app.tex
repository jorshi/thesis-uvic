\startappendix{Additional Information}
\label{chapter:appendix}

This is a good place to put tables, lots of results, perhaps all the data compiled in the experiments. By avoiding putting all the results inside the chapters themselves, the whole thing may become much more readable and the various tables can be linked to appropriately.

The main purpose of an Appendix however should be to take care of the future readers and researchers. This implies listing all the housekeeping facts needed to continue the research. For example: where is the raw data stored? where is the software used? which version of which operating system or library or experimental equipment was used and where can it be accessed again?

Ask yourself: if you were given this thesis to read with the goal that you will be expanding the research presented here, what would you like to have as housekeeping information and what do you need? Be kind to the future graduate students and to your supervisor who will be the one stuck in the middle trying to find where all the stuff was left!
