		  provide a form of creative collaboration between the user
		  and machine. While some see the involvement of the user in
		  the process as indication of the failure to truly develop
		  computational creativity, another perspective would view it
		  as an instance of a distributed system leveraging the
		  strength of both the human and the computer. ImageSpace was
		  developed to explore this dynamic further, providing an
		  embodied interface based on spatial layout to make the
		  communication more fluid. This paper discusses the way
		  information is exchanged through interaction with the
		  space, and how it can improve the experience of creating
		  artwork with the system.},

		  from a fused auditory event. Its perceptual representation
		  has been explored as a multidimensional attribute whose
		  different dimensions can be related to abstract spectral,
		  temporal, and spectrotemporal properties of the audio
		  signal, although previous knowledge of the sound source
		  itself also plays a role. Perceptual dimensions can also be
		  related to acoustic properties that directly carry
		  information about the mechanical processes of a sound
		  source, including its geometry (size, shape), its material
		  composition, and the way it is set into vibration. Another
		  conception of timbre is as a spectromorphology encompassing
		  time-varying frequency and amplitude behaviors, as well as
		  spectral and temporal modulations. In all musical sound
		  sources, timbre covaries with fundamental frequency (pitch)
		  and playing effort (loudness, dynamic level) and displays
		  strong interactions with these parameters.",

  abstract	= {Ranking has been extensively studied in information
		  retrieval, machine learning and statistics. A central
		  problem in ranking is to design a ranking measure for
		  evaluation of ranking functions. State of the art leaning
		  to rank methods often train a ranking function by using a
		  ranking measure as the objective to maximize. In this paper
		  we study, from a theoretical perspective, the widely used
		  NDCG type ranking measures. We analyze the behavior of
		  these ranking measures as the number of objects to rank
		  getting large. We first show that, whatever the ranking
		  function is, the standard NDCG which adopts a logarithmic
		  discount, converges to 1 as the number of items to rank
		  goes to infinity. On the first sight, this result seems to
		  imply that NDCG cannot distinguish good and bad ranking
		  functions, contradicting to the empirical success of NDCG
		  in many applications. Our next main result is a theorem
		  which shows that although NDCG converge to the same limit
		  for all ranking functions, it has distinguishability for
		  ranking functions in a strong sense. We then investigate
		  NDCG with other possible discount. Specifically we
		  characterize the class of feasible discount functions for
		  NDCG. We also compare the limiting behavior and the power
		  of distinguishability of these feasible NDCG type measures
		  to the standard NDCG. We next turn to the cut-off version
		  of NDCG, i.e., NDCG@k. The most popular NDCG@k uses a
		  combination of a slow logarithmic decay and a hard cut-off
		  as its discount. So a natural question is why not simply
		  use a smooth discount with fast decay? We show that if the
		  decay is too fast, then the NDCG measure does not have
		  strong power of distinguishability and even not converge.
		  Finally, feasible NDCG@k are also discussed.}
