\section{Audio Representations}
- how do we represent audio digitally?
- That tutorial by that ableton author was helpful -- maybe can link to that.
- Don't go into too much depth here.
- What is a perceptually relevant method for representing audio?
- Spectral features
- STFT

% Not totally sure how to incorporate these sections?
\subsection{Learned Audio Representations}
- Representation learning \cite{bengio2013representation}
- Introduce machine learning
- self-supervised learning
- Learned audio representations
- Give a brief plug for HEAR 2021 and the need for perceptual audio representations
